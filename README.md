## üìù Release Notes
Version 1.0  
New features: Home Screen, Drawer, Locations, Announcements, Inventory for every location  
Known Bugs: Login is not always working as expected, and on Android the status bar has extra padding when navigating out of the homescreen.

## üöÄ Usage
The app is (or will be soon) available on the iOS App Store and Google Play Store under the name `Klemis Kitchen`. First install `node.js` and `yarn` and clone the project from github. To run it locally for development, within the project directory use  
```
yarn install
yarn start
```
A browser window will open with the Expo dashboard. From there, you can choose to run the app in a browser window, or on an Android/iOS device via an emulator or the [Expo](https://expo.io/) app.

## üîß Configuration
The default (production) configuration of the app points to `api.klemis-kitchen.com` to retrieve pantry information from. This server runs `Klemis Kitchen API` on a Georgia Tech-hosted platform.  
To change where to fetch data from, edit `APIFETCHLOCATION` in `constants.tsx`
